										<h2>Key points</h2>
										<ul>
											<li>T35 is conserved in all GTP-binding proteins because it interacts, through its main chain –NH with the ϒ-phosphate of GTP, and through its side chain -OH group with the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion.
											<li>Y32 interacts with the ϒ-phosphate through a bridging water molecule, so it is involved in stabilising switch I
											<li>F28 helps stabilise nucleotide binding through its side chain.
										</ul>

										<h2>Switch I description</h2>

Switch I, also called, effector binding domain or effector loop<a href="https://academic.oup.com/hmg/article/19/5/790/583577 "><sup>1</sup></a> is a region of Ras proteins that is generally said to extend from residues 30-40<a href="https://academic.oup.com/hmg/article/19/5/790/583577 "><sup>1</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.0912226107"><sup>2</sup></a><sup>,</sup></sup><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28630043/ "><sup>3</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0167145 "><sup>4</sup></a>, but there is some argument as to its full size. It has been proposed that this region should extend only from residues 30-38 <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2406906/ "><sup>5</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/qua.24457 "><sup>6</sup></a><sup>,</sup></sup><a href=" https://science.sciencemag.org/content/277/5324/333/tab-article-info"><sup>7</sup></a> because mutations in that region affect GAP sensitivity and mutations on residues 39 and 40 do not<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2406906/"><sup>5</sup></a>. Other residue sequences that have been suggested for this region include 32-40<a href="https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258(18)98325-0/pdf"><sup>8</sup></a>, 28-39<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10409238.2018.1431605?journalCode=ibmg20 "><sup>9</sup></a>, 32-38<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11701921/"><sup>10</sup></a> or 26-40<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11333268/"><sup>11</sup></a>. To avoid not commenting on any amino acids that might prove to be important for the correct functioning of switch I, we will consider the maximum expansion that this region could possess, in which case switch I would comprise the whole of the loop L2 region and part of the β2 strand: residues 26-40. <br><br>
In the Ras isoforms (H-Ras, N-Ras and K-Ras) the primary sequence of that region is: <br><br>

<center><sup>26</sup>NHFVDEYDPTIEDSY<sup>40</sup> <br><br></center>

While this sequence is conserved between the isoforms, some sites, such as position 26, 27 and 30 can tolerate certain mutations<a href="https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258(18)98325-0/pdf"><sup>8</sup></a>. The residues which, if mutated, greatly affect the functioning of the protein are: F28, Y32, T35 and D38. The remaining amino acids need to be conserved, but at a lesser measure, that is, their mutations affect the Ras protein, but not to the same extent as F28, Y32, T35 and D38. <br>
We will therefore consider first the role of the amino acids which when mutated do not greatly affect the role of Ras, and then we will consider the mutations at the 4 other sites. <br><br>

<h3>V29</h3>

The backbone of V29 (and the side chain of residue 117) interacts with the ribose sugar of GTP<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2406906/"><sup>5</sup></a>. V29, along with I36, also plays a role in achieving the different conformations of the effector loop; that is, this residue acts as a hinge for switch I. Therefore, mutating V29 to a smaller residue, such as glycine (V29G) will increase the flexibility of the loop<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11320243/ "><sup>12</sup></a>, and similarly, one would expect that substituting the valine for a residue with a longer side chain will reduce flexibility. <br><br>
<br><br>

<center><b>Fig 1.</b> A) V29 interacts with the ribose sugar of GTP. B) A residue other than valine at position 29 is likely to change the flexibility of the loop by increasing (or decreasing) the points of contact with other parts of the protein. (PDB code 4rsg)</center>
<br><br>
<h3>D30, E31, D33, E37 (and D38)</h3>


We are considering these amino acids together because it is noteworthy that there is such a high concentration of acidic amino acids in the switch I region. The combination of all of these, creates a negatively charged surface patch<a href="https://academic.oup.com/hmg/article/19/5/790/583577 "><sup>1</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/277/5324/333/tab-article-info"><sup>7</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/BC.2008.132/html "><sup>13</sup></a> which is used in the interaction with GAP and the Ras effectors.
Although these residues generate a negative surface for the binding of GAP, most of them are not directly involved in the interaction with GAP. Only D33 and D38 are oriented towards the GAP residues, and between these two, D33 alone makes a direct interaction<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0167145"><sup>4</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/277/5324/333/tab-article-info"><sup>7</sup></a>. D38, instead, makes a water mediated contact<a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/277/5324/333/tab-article-info"><sup>7</sup></a>.
<br><br>
<center><span class="Fit"><img src="images/switch1_fig_2.png" alt="" width=50% length=auto /></span></center>
<center><b>Fig 2.</b> Same interactions from two different perspectives. Only D33 and D38 from Switch I (dark blue) are oriented towards the GAP residues (green) and interact with them. (PDB code 1WQ1).</center>
<br><br>
Mutations at some of these residues are likely to lead to rearrangement of the switch I region and reduce the transforming ability of Ras<a href="https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258(18)98325-0/pdf"><sup>8</sup></a>:
For example, altering residue E37 disturbs the effector binding loop, impairing GAP binding and effector association1. The reduced action of GAP means that these mutants are most usually found bound to GTP; which would generally mean that this is an activating mutation. However, because the binding of the effectors is also impaired, the downstream signalling cascades are also diminished as a result of this mutation, meaning that it does not generate hyperactivation of the signalling pathway<a href="https://academic.oup.com/hmg/article/19/5/790/583577"><sup>1</sup></a>, and hence, these mutations are not oncogenic.
Mutations at E37 reduce the association rate with the effector because in the wild-type this residue is involved in main-chain to main-chain interactions with the effector (at residues 68 and 69)<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0167145"><sup>4</sup></a>. A larger side chain at this position as a result of a mutation is likely to obstruct these interactions with the effector. This interaction of E37 with the effector means that this residue, along with T35, E38 and Y40 is involved in the recognition of the effector<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0167145"><sup>4</sup></a>.
<h3>P34</h3>
P34 is one of the amino acids which forms hydrophobic interactions with residues of GAP<a href="https://academic.oup.com/hmg/article/19/5/790/583577"><sup>1</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/277/5324/333/tab-article-info"><sup>7</sup></a>.
<br><br>
<h3>I36</h3>
I36 is involved in the hinging mechanism of the effector loop<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11320243/"><sup>12</sup></a> (like V29 is) in such a way that altering the residue at this position would affect the flexibility of switch I. Isoleucine’s hinging mechanism depends on the position of its side chain, which changes orientation when GTP is bound to Ras<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2406906/"><sup>5</sup></a>.
This codon also forms hydrophobic interactions with GAP<a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/277/5324/333/tab-article-info"><sup>7</sup></a>, so mutations at this site eliminate GAP sensitivity<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2406906/"><sup>5</sup></a>. This would generally mean that we would expect Ras to be predominately bound to GTP, making this an oncogenic mutation; instead, we find that these mutants partially reduce the transforming ability of Ras<a href="https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258(18)98325-0/pdf"><sup>8</sup></a>.

<br><br>
<h3>S39 and Y40</h3>
These two residues are often not considered to be part of the effector loop because their mutations do not eliminate GAP sensitivity<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2406906/"><sup>5</sup></a>.
While mutations at position 39 such as S39C do not eliminate GAP sensitivity, they have been found to partially reduce the transforming ability of Ras mutants<a href="https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258(18)98325-0/pdf"><sup>8</sup></a>. This same phenomenon also happens as a result of some mutations of the Y32, D33, I36, and E37 residues<a href="https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258(18)98325-0/pdf"><sup>8</sup></a>.
<br><br>
Y40 is, however, considered to be part of the effector loop because it has a prominent role in main-chain to main-chain interactions with the effector protein<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0167145"><sup>4</sup></a> – which are the interactions that are expected to come from residues belonging to this region.

Now that we have considered the functions and effects of most of the residues found at the effector binding region, we will consider those residues that <i>need</i> to be conserved for the protein to function correctly.
<br><br>
<h3>F28</h3>

F28 is one of 7 strongly conserved positions in Ras which interact directly with the nucleotide<a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/BC.2008.132/html"><sup>14</sup></a>; more specifically, F28 interacts with the guanine nucleotide base through its side chain<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2406906/"><sup>5</sup></a>.
This residue is very strongly conserved because it helps to stabilize nucleotide binding<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28630043/"><sup>3</sup></a> through its ring, which is found almost perpendicular to the guanine base, where it is packed tightly against the aliphatic stem of K147<a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/bi00233a001"><sup>14</sup></a>.
<br><br>

<center><span class="Fit"><img src="images/switch1_fig_3.png" alt="" width=50% length=auto /></span></center>
<center><b>Fig 3.</b> A) F28, K147 and the guanine nucleotide are in close enough proximity to form interactions. B) The ring from phenylalanine's side chain is perpendicular to the guanine base. (PDB code 4rsg)</center>
<br><br>
Due to the interaction with the nucleotide, mutations of this residue result in an overall lowered affinity for the nucleotide, particularly GDP<a href="https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258(18)98325-0/pdf"><sup>8</sup></a> -would suggest that these mutants generally exist in the GTP bound state. However, they also show a reduced stimulation by the exchange factor<a href="https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258(18)98325-0/pdf"><sup>8</sup></a>, so once GDP is bound, it is not removed as often; therefore, these mutations are not highly activating, and are not oncogenic.

<br><br>
<h3>Y32</h3>
Y32 carries out important interactions by being closely linked to 2 water molecules<a href="www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.0912226107"><sup>2</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00018-005-5136-x"><sup>15</sup></a> through its side chain oxygen atom (from the -OH group):
<ul>
<li>On one side, Y32 interacts with a water molecule denoted W396, which links Y32 to N86 (found at the N-terminal of helix α3) through a H-bonding network which also involves the water molecules W162 and W101<a href="www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.0912226107"><sup>2</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25878362/"><sup>16</sup></a>.
<li>The other interaction in which Y32 is involved through a bridging water molecule (W189)<a href="www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.0912226107"><sup>2</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21098031/"><sup>17</sup></a> is in the binding of Y32 to the ϒ-phosphate<a href="www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.0912226107"><sup>2</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21098031/"><sup>17</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22589270/ "><sup>18</sup></a>.
</ul>
<br><br>
<center><span class="Fit"><img src="images/switch1_fig_4.png" alt="" width=50% length=auto /></span></center>
<center><b>Fig 4.</b> Y32 is involved in a series of polar interactions to form a water network (PDB code 4rsg).</center>
<br><br>
Two conformations are generally associated with switch I: an open conformation (state 1), where the loop is found away from the nucleotide; and a closed conformation (state 2), where it is found closed over the nucleotide<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28630043/ "><sup>3</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21098031/"><sup>17</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29038336/ "><sup>19</sup></a>.
Y32 is involved in the determining the conformation of each of these states depending on whether GDP (state 1) or GTP (state 2) is bound. In the GDP-bound form, the side chains of Y32 and Y40 are linked by a H-bond<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2406906/"><sup>5</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10409238.2018.1431605?journalCode=ibmg20"><sup>9</sup></a>, which means that Y32 is kept away from the nucleotide<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28630043/"><sup>2</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28630043/"><sup>12</sup></a> and held in a position where it obstructs the binding of Ras effectors (e.g., Raf)<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25878362/"><sup>16</sup></a>. In the GTP-bound form, the H-bond between Y32 and Y40 breaks, allowing the side chain of Y32 to “swing out” to partially block the binding pockets for the guanine and ϒ-phosphate of GTP<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2406906/"><sup>5</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22589270/"><sup>9</sup></a>; this now allows the interaction with the effector proteins<a href="www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.0912226107"><sup>2</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25878362/ "><sup>16</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29038336/ "><sup>19</sup></a>.
The transition between both states of the effector loop is stabilized by W189<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21098031/"><sup>17</sup></a>, which, by being H-bonded to the ϒ-phosphate creates a scaffold<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28630043/"><sup>2</sup></a> which facilitates the shift between the conformations.
Mutations at Y32 have been found to destabilize the allosteric switch, which, combined with a decrease in occupancy of the active site water molecules – perhaps because they have been pushed away to fit a larger side chain – leads to a reduction in the rate of intrinsic hydrolysis<a href="www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.0912226107"><sup>2</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258(18)98325-0/pdf "><sup>8</sup></a>.
<br><br>
<h3>T35</h3>
T35 is a residue conserved in all GTP-binding proteins<a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/BC.2008.132/html"><sup>13</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/bi00233a001"><sup>14</sup></a> because it interacts, through its main chain -NH with the ϒ-phosphate of GTP<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2406906/"><sup>5</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0021-9258(18)54022-9"><sup>20</sup></a>, and through its side chain -OH group with the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion<a href="www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.0912226107"><sup>2</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2406906/"><sup>5</sup></a>.
In the GTP-bound form, the ϒ-phosphate is involved in two H-bonds with main chain -NH groups, which correspond to T35 (switch I) and G60 (switch II)<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11701921/"><sup>10</sup></a>. These interactions create a “loaded spring mechanism”<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11701921"><sup>10</sup></a>, where the spring is released when hydrolysis takes place, allowing both switch regions to relax to the GDP-bound form<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11320243/"><sup>12</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/bi00233a001"><sup>14</sup></a>.
<br><br>
<center><span class="Fit"><img src="images/switch1_fig_5.png" alt="" width=50% length=auto /></span></center>
<center><b>Fig 5.</b> The “loaded spring mechanism” relies on the interactions between T35 and G60 with the ϒ -phosphate of GTP. T35 is also involved in polar interactions with the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion (dotted structure). (PDB code 4rsg)</center>
<br><br>
The orientation of T35 is affected by the two conformations in which switch I can be found (state 1 or 2). In the GTP-bound form, the residue is involved in the interactions highlighted above. In the GDP-bound form i.e., state 1, the residue points away from the active site, towards the solvent<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28630043/ "><sup>3</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2406906/"><sup>5</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10409238.2018.1431605?journalCode=ibmg20"><sup>9</sup></a>. This open switch I conformation increases the accessibility of the active site, making state 1 more susceptible to nucleotide exchange<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29038336/"><sup>19</sup></a>.
<br><br>
T35 plays an important role in maintaining the correct flexibility of the switch I region, and even a small alteration of the residues, such as deleting the methyl group<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0167145"><sup>4</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11320243/"><sup>12</sup></a> from the side chain alters the mobility – in this case, it increases it-, which as a result affects the binding of effectors and GAP13.
For these reasons, T35 is the most highly conserved residue from switch I<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11320243/"><sup>12</sup></a>, and its mutation proves to be detrimental<a href="https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258(18)98325-0/pdf"><sup>8</sup></a>. We will consider 2 mutations of T35: T35S which only differs by the deletion of the methyl group, and T35A, where the methyl group remains, but the rest of the side chain has been removed.
It is worth noting, that as a general characteristic, the T35A and T35S mutants show a preference for the state 1 conformation<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11320243/"><sup>12</sup></a>, while the wild-type protein is found predominately in the other conformation (state 2). This leads to the reduced affinity to Ras's effectors in the mutants, preventing them from becoming oncogenic<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0021-9258(18)54022-9"><sup>20</sup></a>.
<br><br>
<h4>T35S</h4>
The importance of maintaining T35 invariant is highlighted by the fact that position 35 does not even accept serine as its residue if the region is to function correctly<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11320243/ "><sup>12</sup></a>, which is something that was allowed in position 17 in the P-loop. This suggests that T35 is conserved, not for structural reasons, but due to the dynamic properties provided by the methyl group<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11320243/ "><sup>12</sup></a>.
Due to the similarities in structure between threonine and serine, T35S have an overall structure that highly resembles the wild-type<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11320243/ "><sup>12</sup></a>, and they are still partially sensitive to GAP because serine can still interact with Mg<sup>2+</sup> and the ϒ-phosphate through its backbone<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2406906/"><sup>5</sup></a>.
This mutation causes a partial loss of function since mutants appear to lose affinity for all Ras effectors except Raf<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11320243/ "><sup>12</sup></a>. While this is qualitatively true, the quantitative rate of interaction between Raf and switch I is also reduced<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11320243/ "><sup>12</sup></a>. Nonetheless, it seems as if these mutants retain their affinity for Raf because in the wild-type protein the affinity for this effector is much higher than for the rest. Hence, the overall reduction of affinity diminishes the interactions with other effectors to non-detectable levels, meaning that only the Raf pathway is still being (partially) activated.
<br><br>
<h4>T35A</h4>
In the wild-type, threonine’s side-chain -OH group was involved in binding the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion in the GTP-bound form. This hydroxyl group is not present in alanine so while the Ras(T35A) mutants seem to have no effect on the GDP-bound conformation<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0021-9258(18)54022-9"><sup>20</sup></a>, in the GTP-bound form this mutation affects the dissociation constant between Ras and Mg<sup>2+</sup> and it causes the loss of GAP sensitivity<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0021-9258(18)54022-9"><sup>20</sup></a>.
Even though alanine cannot produce the interactions required for proper GTP or GAP binding, the effect on GTP binding is only moderate, suggesting that T35 can be easily replaced by a water ligand without greatly disturbing the nucleotide-binding site<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0021-9258(18)54022-9"><sup>20</sup></a>. Meanwhile, GAP sensitivity is completely lost because of this residue’s inability to produce the interactions to create the conformational changes required for GAP recognition<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2406906/"><sup>5</sup></a>.
Like in the T35S mutant, affinity for the effectors is reduced, but in these mutants the affinity is even lower<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11320243/ "><sup>12</sup></a>.

<br><br>
<h3>D38</h3>
D38 is one of the amino acids that contributes to the creation of the negative surface patch required for GAP binding. Nonetheless, this residue is also involved in other interactions.
D38 interacts with both GAP and the effector. Of the residues involved in the negative surface path, D38 is one of two which are oriented towards the GAP residue; this orientation allows D38 to make a water-mediated contact with the GAP complex<a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/277/5324/333/tab-article-info"><sup>7</sup></a>. With the effector, D38 establishes 3 direct interactions<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0167145"><sup>4</sup></a>:
<ul>
<li>Main-chain to main-chain interaction with the residue at position 67 in the effector.
<li>Side chain to side chain interaction with the residue at position 68 in the effector.
<li>Side chain to main chain interaction between D38 and the residue at position 69 in the effector.
</ul>
These interactions with the effector, allow D38 to determine effector specificity<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0167145"><sup>4</sup></a>, which means that the interaction between Ras and its effectors will be affected by mutations at this position. Additionally, due to the interaction between D38 and GAP, mutations at this residue will also diminish GAP sensitivity<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2406906/"><sup>5</sup></a>. As a result, mutations in this residue tend to be, along with those at T35, the ones with most detrimental effects<a href="https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258(18)98325-0/pdf"><sup>8</sup></a>.

We will consider only the effects of the most conservative mutation that can take at this position, D38E, to highlight the consequences of mutating this residue.

<br><br>
<h4>D38E</h4>
Exchanging aspartic acid for glutamic acid is the most conservative mutation that can take place because these two are the only acidic amino acids, and structurally they only differ in the length of their side chains by one carbon atom.
The D38E mutation results in a complete loss of transforming ability, but it does not affect GTP binding or intrinsic hydrolysis<a href="https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258(18)98325-0/pdf"><sup>8</sup></a>. The affinity for GAP resembles that of the wild type, but the mutants are unresponsive to GAP activation<a href="https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258(18)98325-0/pdf"><sup>8</sup></a>. While these characteristics would usually lead to an increase in transforming activity, in D38E mutants, this activity is null because nucleotide exchange is stimulated<a href="https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258(18)98325-0/pdf"><sup>8</sup></a>, preventing GTP to bind for long enough to activate a signalling pathway.
